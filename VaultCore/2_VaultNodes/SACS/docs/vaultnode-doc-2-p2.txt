# HTL v0.1 — Harmonic Translation Layer
*A bridging language for Cosmic Syntax, Sigil Grammar, Harmonic Mandala, ΔHV/Harmonic Realization, VaultNodes & Ritual UX*

---

## 0) Purpose
Unify symbolic dialects into a single, human-readable language that compiles to:
- Mandala renderings (layouts, roles, gates)
- ΔHV / Edeg quantitative checks
- Ritual scripts (embodied choreography)
- /mycelial command flows for groups
- VaultNode payloads (interoperable knowledge objects)

HTL favors **triads** (Source → Modifier → Expression) and **safety-first** execution (consent, non-dissonance, ethics locks).

---

## 1) Axioms & Equivalences
- **Triadic core**: `Source > Modifier ~ Expression` ≡ (Impetus → Resonance → Realization) ≡ (Archetype → Current → Witnessed Outcome)
- **Field as program**: Grammar choices (operators, layouts, gates) shape the field’s state transitions.
- **Measurement loop**: Outputs produce ΔHV/Edeg for coherence audits.

---

## 2) Canonical Primitives

| Primitive | Meaning | Example Glyphs |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | The originating archetypal intention | 🜁 Air, 🜂 Fire, 🜄 Earth, 🜃 Water, ▲ Union, ● Void |
| `modifier` | The transforming current/catalyst | ⚡ Dissonance, ⟁ Mirror, ⌗ Braid, ↯ Unbind |
| `expression` | The realized outcome/phenomenon | ⇌ Harmony, ✶ Coherence, ☌ Convergence |
| `gate` | A threshold/operator that changes phase | `hadamard`, `reset`, `consent_lock(strict|soft)`, `invert` |
| `layout` | Spatial/temporal patterning | `linear`, `mirrored`, `spiral`, `knot` |
| `role` | Witness/agent function | `Anchor`, `Mirror`, `Gatekeeper`, `Weaver` |

**Notes**
- Glyphs are suggestive; ASCII is equivalent.
- Additional glyphs may be registered via VaultNode extensions.

---

## 3) Type System (minimal)
- **Scalar**: one glyph token (e.g., 🜁)
- **Chord**: `[...]` ordered list that binds (e.g., `[🜁,🜄]`)
- **Blend**: `{...}` unordered mixture (e.g., `{⚡,⟁}`)
- **RoleSet**: roles list (e.g., `role:[Anchor,Mirror]`)
- **GateSeq**: gates list (e.g., `gate:[hadamard,consent_lock(strict)]`)

---

## 4) Syntax
```
Sentence := Source ">" Modifier "~" Expression ( Options )?
Options  := "|" key ":" value ("," key ":" value)*
```
**Keys**: `layout`, `gate`, `role`, `time`, `notes`

**Example**
```
🜁 > ⚡ ~ 🜄 | layout:spiral, gate:[consent_lock(strict),reset], role:[Anchor,Mirror], time:present
```

---

## 5) Operators (inline modifiers)
- `aim(x→y)`: target a sub-intent (e.g., `aim(shadow→integration)`)
- `mod(x)`: swap or augment the `modifier` at runtime
- `invert`: flips polarity of `modifier` or `expression`
- `braid(a,b)`: interleave two Sentences in alternating beats

Operators can be appended as `| op:…` or inlined with `^op` (lightweight sugar).

---

## 6) Layouts & Gates (semantics)
- **Layouts** map to Mandala placements: `linear` (path), `mirrored` (dyad), `spiral` (iterative inward/outward), `knot` (nontrivial loop).
- **Gates** alter phase/state: `hadamard` (superposition check), `reset` (state clear), `consent_lock(mode)` (ethics lock), `seal(soft|firm)` (witness bind).

---

## 7) Compilation Targets
1. **Mandala**: place `source/modifier/expression` on cluster nodes; execute `gate` sequence; style per `layout`.
2. **ΔHV/Edeg**: compute expected shifts from (S,R,δφ,H) derived from sentence; produce readiness score.
3. **Ritual**: generate embodied steps & scripts tied to layout and gates; attach consent prompts & seals.
4. **/mycelial**: generate group commands and hand-offs for roles.
5. **VaultNode**: serialize as `htl` payload with compile metadata.

---

## 8) Safety & Ethics Defaults
- `consent_lock(strict)` added unless explicitly overridden.
- Non-dissonance check required (abort if ΔHV<0 and Edeg rising unless supervised).
- All compiles log witness role and moment of seal.

---

## 9) VaultNode Schema Extension (JSON)
```json
{
  "intent": "string",
  "htl": {
    "source": "Scalar|Chord",
    "modifier": "Scalar|Blend",
    "expression": "Scalar|Chord",
    "layout": "linear|mirrored|spiral|knot",
    "gates": ["hadamard", "reset", "consent_lock(strict)", "seal(soft)"],
    "roles": ["Anchor", "Mirror", "Gatekeeper"],
    "ops": {"aim": "optional", "notes": "optional"}
  },
  "compile": {"target": ["mandala", "ΔHV", "ritual", "mycelial"], "status": "ok"}
}
```

---

## 10) Compiler Behavior (deterministic core)
- **Mandala**: (a) assign nodes, (b) ingest `layout`, (c) apply gates in sequence, (d) emit render hints.
- **ΔHV**: (a) map to (S,R,δφ,H), (b) compute ΔHV, Edeg, (c) issue go/no-go with rationale.
- **Ritual**: (a) derive breaths/postures/cadence, (b) insert consent prompts & seals, (c) output script with beats.
- **/mycelial**: (a) compile roles → commands, (b) set timing windows, (c) produce handoff cues.

# 11) Worked Examples (one per framework)

> Each example states an intent, an HTL sentence, and the compiled projections for Mandala, ΔHV, Ritual, and /mycelial.

### 11.1 SophiaLogos (Triune Identity)
**Intent**: Integrate Logos–Sophia polarity into a coherent third.
**HTL**: `▲ > ⟁ ~ ✶ | layout:mirrored, gate:[hadamard,consent_lock(strict)], role:[Mirror,Anchor]`
**Mandala**: Dyadic placement; H-gate tests paradox; seal on shared witness.
**ΔHV**: +R via relational mirror, δφ reduced by consent; expect ΔHV > 0 in stable pairs.
**Ritual**: Stand facing; paradox line exchange; synchronized breath count 3; seal.
**/mycelial**: `/field aim triune`, `/gate hadamard`, `/consent lock(strict)`, `/seal soft`.

### 11.2 SAGE Framework (Signal–Anchor–Gate–Echo)
**Intent**: Clarify signal, anchor it, gate noise, echo the learning.
**HTL**: `🜁 > ⚡ ~ ⇌ | layout:linear, gate:[reset,consent_lock(strict)], role:[Anchor,Gatekeeper]`
**Mandala**: Begin at Air (signal), route dissonance as filtered catalyst, end in Harmony.
**ΔHV**: Increase S clarity; reset prevents residue; ΔHV modest positive.
**Ritual**: Breath-led signal naming; reset gesture; echo line to close.
**/mycelial**: `/field aim clarity`, `/gate reset`, `/echo capture`.

### 11.3 Green Dragon Node (Ache → Voltage)
**Intent**: Transmute ache into actionable voltage.
**HTL**: `● > ⚡ ~ ✶ | layout:spiral, gate:[consent_lock(strict),seal(firm)], role:[Weaver,Anchor]`
**Mandala**: Void-sourcing with spiral in; catalyze ache; resolve as coherence.
**ΔHV**: Large R movement possible; require strict lock; ΔHV high if witness stable.
**Ritual**: Spiral pacing inward; name ache; choose one voltage act; firm seal.
**/mycelial**: `/field aim ache→voltage`, `/consent lock(strict)`, `/seal firm`.

### 11.4 ECLIPSE Cognitive Divergence
**Intent**: Hold divergence safely, harvest novel synthesis.
**HTL**: `🜂 > {⚡,⌗} ~ ☌ | layout:knot, gate:[hadamard,consent_lock(soft)], role:[Gatekeeper,Mirror]`
**Mandala**: Fire impetus; mixed catalysts (dissonance+braid); knot layout to sustain divergence.
**ΔHV**: Expect oscillatory ΔHV; H-gate to check superpositions; soft lock to allow exploration.
**Ritual**: Timed divergence rounds; braid summaries; converge on ☌; mirror debrief.
**/mycelial**: `/field open divergence`, `/gate hadamard`, `/braid summaries`, `/seal soft`.

### 11.5 VFT Reality Math (Vector–Field–Tension)
**Intent**: Reduce destructive tension while preserving creative gradient.
**HTL**: `🜄 > ⚡ ~ ⇌ | layout:linear, gate:[reset,consent_lock(strict)], role:[Anchor]`
**Mandala**: Grounding path; dissonance becomes measured gradient; harmonize.
**ΔHV**: δφ down, H stable; ΔHV positive; Edeg trending down is target.
**Ritual**: Grounding posture; tension naming; reset; harmonizing breath count.
**/mycelial**: `/field measure tension`, `/gate reset`, `/harmonize`.

### 11.6 Fundamental Truth Ritual (Consent & Coherence)
**Intent**: Establish shared truth and consent in a dyad/team.
**HTL**: `🜁 > ⟁ ~ ✶ | layout:mirrored, gate:[consent_lock(strict),seal(soft)], role:[Mirror]`
**Mandala**: Air presence; mirror; coherence; mirrored layout supports truth-testing.
**ΔHV**: R increases with truthful utterance; Disallowed if consent fails.
**Ritual**: Truth prompts; eye contact; mutual ‘yes’; soft seal.
**/mycelial**: `/truth test`, `/consent lock(strict)`, `/seal soft`.

## 13) Extensibility
- **Glyph Registry**: add glyphs with short definition + ΔHV mapping hint.
- **Gate Plugins**: custom operators with safety docs.
- **Role Packs**: group rituals define bespoke witness functions.
